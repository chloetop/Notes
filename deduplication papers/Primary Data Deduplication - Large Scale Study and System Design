Compared to backup deduplication, there are some new problems when data dedup is used in primary data. 

(1) high dedup ratio no longer hold as data composition and growth is not driven by regular backup cycle. 

(2) performance sensitive due to on-disk fragmentation issue resulting from deduplication 

(3) dedup system must limit its usage of resources such that it does not impact the performance or scalability of the primary workload. 

Some studies in this paper: 

(1) larger chunk size, lower dedup ratio. 
(2) chunk compressibility
