Note that the lower bound for comparison-based sorting algorithm is Omega(n). 

Union-Find Set 

why the time complexity for list-based union-find set is O(logn) to add an element?

because the list is sorted. 

Radix-sort is a specialization of lexicographic sorting where bucket-sort is used as the stable sorting in every dimension.
