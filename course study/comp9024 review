Homework 4 Q2. 

Homework 4 Q5. The rules of mod% for positive numbers cannot be used for negative numbers directively. 

The knowledge need to be reviewed. 

Big omega notation. 

Homework 5 Q2

be aware of the height and depth of tree. 

Homework 5 Q4

Note that the question is that the descendants diff is no more than 5, not the height...

Homework 5 Q5

Do not forget to reset the visit flag of nodes. 

Homework 6 
Q1 the height of avl-tree < 2log(n) + 2, the height of splay tree is h < log(n+1)

external node is the nodes which do not store anything. 

Q6 removeExternal is to remove the external node and its parent, replace its parent by its sibling. 

So if removeExternal is called during the remove, if the deleted node's parent is root. In that case, the other child of the root would become 
the root afterwards, so it is still an AVL tree. 
Else if the parent is not root, the only AVL-tree which would become non-AVL tree is the one rooted at w (which is the parent of the parent of v)

Homework 7 

Q2 just use the recursive algorithm to scan each node

Q5 note that the first transformation of the sum equation and when n> 3, the equation i<2^(i/2) holds.
