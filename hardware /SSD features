FTL (Flash Translation Layer)

The feature of SSD is that 
1. the NAND flash cannot be written randomly like memory. Before writting to a certain page, the content of that page needs to be deleted at first. 
   So if SSD still follows this rule, then it would be very hard to use. Because the most time would be consumed on deleting. The principle of SSD is
   very similar to log-structured storage. So the new write do not need to write to the former page, it can just be written to a new one. The FTL can 
   map this new one to the that data. 
   
2. Why garbage collection
   Since the page is never updated by a in-place-update way, when a page is re-mapped, the old one would be expired. So we need garbage collection. 
   However, since the erasure needs to be done at the block level, the GC needs to do some data migration during the collection. This would have some 
   negative impact on the global write performance.
