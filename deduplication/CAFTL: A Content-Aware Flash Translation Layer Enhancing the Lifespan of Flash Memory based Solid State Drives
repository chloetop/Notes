The main concern of this paper is that the lifespan of SSD devices is much shorter compared with HDDs. So the authors solve 
this problem in the FTL. By reducing the duplicate writes to SSDs, the lifespan increases. 

An interesting reference can be, although the bit density of SSD grows, the raliability of SSDs is even worse.
