The metadata mentioned here is like logical to physical block mapping, physical block reference counters, block fingerprints. 

The key idea of this paper is to use reorder rather than certain hardware or log to achieve the consistency of metadata. 

Traditional methods to keep the consistency between data and their metadata:

journaling, easy to understand, like ext file systems.  
shadowing, use a copy-on-write fashion, and use atomic modifying of the file index to point the file to the new version.
